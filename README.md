# KDTreeAlgorithm

## Overview
KDTreeAlgorithm is a Java project that implements the KD-Tree (k-dimensional tree) algorithm, a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. The KD-Tree is useful for various applications, such as range searches and nearest neighbor searches. This project also includes unit tests to ensure the correct functionality of the KD-Tree implementation.

## Features
- **KD-Tree Construction:** Efficiently build a KD-Tree from a set of points in k-dimensional space.
- **Range Search:** Perform range searches to find all points within a specified range.
- **Nearest Neighbor Search:** Find the nearest neighbor to a given point.
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests to verify the correctness of the KD-Tree implementation.
